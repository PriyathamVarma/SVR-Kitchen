              <p>A revolution in food. Let it be known that I am a big fan of homemade pesto here, and I find that 
                the best way to do things is to first dunk your bread in the pesto (it thick, flavorful, and delicious) and then dunk your pesto-ed bread 
                into the soup. SO GOOD. 
                                              Fresh flavor in every nook and cranny.
                                              I still have a bunch of basil left in my garden that is nearing the end of its life (aka winter is coming), so I am excited to be making a 
                                              bunch of pesto right now. And the flavor ugh. Its so fresh and so good. I was licking the remnants of it 
                                              right out of the food processor.</p>
